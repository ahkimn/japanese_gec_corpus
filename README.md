# japanese_gec_corpus

A repository containing a human-annotated corpus for Japanese GEC

## Corpus

The corpus is contained in the file corpus_v0.txt, which is organized as follows:

- Each line consists an error-correct sentence pair
- The error sentence is first, followed by a tab, an then the correct sentence
- Each sentence is delimited by a period "ã€‚"
- Error phrases in the error sentence are demarcated by angled brackets "<" and ">"
- Corresponding correct phrases are demarcated by parentheses "(" and ")"

We are continually updating and correcting the corpus. Older versions will be placed in the folder "previous_versions" under the filename corpus_v*.txt (with * being the version number)
